# Advent of Code
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other. 
> See [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

This repository contains my attempts at the puzzles.
My goal is to solve the problems using TDD (Test Driven Development), while keeping the code as simple as possible by sticking to the DRY and SOLID principles.
